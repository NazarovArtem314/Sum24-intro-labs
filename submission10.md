## **Task 1: Artifact Registries Research**

1. ***AWS***:
- **CodeArtifact**
    AWS CodeArtifact is a secure, highly scalable, managed artifact repository service that helps organizations to store and share software packages for application development. CodeArtifact can be used with popular build tools and package managers such as NuGet CLI, Maven, Gradle, npm, yarn, pip and twine. CodeArtifact helps reduce the need for you to manage your own artifact storage system or worry about scaling its infrastructure. There is no limit to the number or total size of packages that can be stored in the CodeArtifact repository.
    You can create a connection between your private CodeArtifact repository and an external, public repository, such as npmjs.com or Maven Central. CodeArtifact will then fetch and store packages on demand from the public repository when they're requested by a package manager. This makes it more convenient to consume open-source dependencies used by your application and helps ensure they're always available for builds and development. You can also publish private packages to a CodeArtifact repository. This helps you share proprietary software components between multiple applications and development teams in your organization.

- **AWS ECR**   
    Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is an AWS managed container image registry service that is secure, scalable, and reliable. Amazon ECR supports private repositories with resource-based permissions using AWS IAM. This is so that specified users or Amazon EC2 instances can access your container repositories and images. You can use your preferred CLI to push, pull, and manage Docker images, Open Container Initiative (OCI) images, and OCI compatible artifacts.

2. ***GCP***:
- Google Container Registry
    Google Container Registry provides secure, private Docker repository storage on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). You can use gcloud to push repositories to your registry, then you can pull repositories using an HTTP endpoint from any machine, whether it's a Google Compute Engine instance or your own hardware. You pay only for storage and internet egress you use, there is no per-image fee.
    Store your private Docker container images on GCP for fast, scalable retrieval and deployment. Container Registry is a private Docker repository that works with popular continuous delivery systems. It runs on GCPâ€™s Andromeda based network fabric to provide consistent uptime on an infrastructure protected by Google's security. Your private images are stored in Google Cloud Storage and cached in our datacenters, ready to be deployed to Google Container Engine clusters or Compute Engine VMs running Container-Optimized OS. In addition, you can create build pipelines with Google Cloud Build that automatically build and push container images to Container Registry from your source repository on Google Cloud Source Repositories, GitHub, or Bitbucket.

- Google Artifact Registry
    Google Artifact Registry: This service allows for a wider variety of artifact kinds, which extends the capabilities of the Container Registry. Artifact Registry can store and manage a lot of package formats, like Maven, npm, and Python packages, in addition to Docker images. It gives you a centrally controlled, flexible solution for managing all of your software artifacts, and includes additional features for security, artifact management, and CI/CD pipeline integration.
